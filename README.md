# Baloise Incubator - Getting Started

Welcome to Baloise Incubator, our Playground OKD container application platform.

See the [official OKD](https://www.okd.io/) docs for an introduction of the features of the platform.

## Access 
You can access the platform at [https://console.baloise.dev/](https://console.baloise.dev/). 
Access is management by GitHub as a SSO provider.
Therefore you need to have a GitHub account.

In order to get access to our cluster you need to get an invitation to the [baloise-incubator](https://github.com/baloise-incubator) organisation.
Ask on of the [members](https://github.com/orgs/baloise-incubator/people) to get an invitation send to your account.

## Applications

As most of our applications are managed by [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/), 
you can access the infrastracture-as-code definitions in our [cluster config GitHub repository](https://github.com/baloise-incubator/cluster-config).

You will also find an overview of the available deployments and some documentation there.
