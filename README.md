# Baloise Incubator - Getting Started

Welcome to Baloise Incubator, our Playground OKD container application platform.

See the [official OKD](https://www.okd.io/) docs for an introduction of the features of the platform.

## Access 
 - You can access the platform at https://console.baloise.dev
 - Access is managed by GitHub as a SSO provider.
 - Therefore you need to have a GitHub account.

In order to get access to our cluster you need to be a member of the [baloise-incubator](https://github.com/baloise-incubator) organization.

To **become a member of the [baloise-incubator](https://github.com/baloise-incubator) organization** simply add your GitHub username to the *members* list [here](https://github.com/baloise-incubator/org/edit/master/config.yaml) and create a pull request. Please also state in the pull request that you've read and understood our [Open Source Guidelines](https://baloise.github.io/open-source/docs/arc42/) and agree to act accordingly. Your request will then be approved by one of the [organization managers](https://github.com/orgs/baloise-incubator/teams/organization-managers) and you're ready to start!

## Applications

As most of our applications are managed by [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/), 
you can access the infrastracture-as-code definitions in our [apps root config repository](https://github.com/baloise-incubator/apps-root-config).

You will also find an overview of the available deployments and some documentation there.
